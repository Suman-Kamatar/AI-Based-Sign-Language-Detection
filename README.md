# AI-Based-Sign-Language-Detection

AI Based Sign Language Detection

Overview
This project focuses on sign language detection using AI-based image classification techniques. The system takes image as an input,then processes using deep learning models, and translates them into text(alphabets).

Technologies Used
Python - used jyputer notebook 
TensorFlow/Keras - for deep learning model training
Gradio - for simple interface

Dataset 
The dataset used for this project is from kaggle.
link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vaishnaviasonawane/indian-sign-language-dataset
Dataset is used for training purpose.
It contains images of the indian sign language.

Model Training
If you don't have a pre-trained model, train your own using the following steps:
1. Collect sign language dataset (images of hand gestures).
2. Dataset preprocessing.
3. Training the model.
4. Save the trained model(/.h5 , /.keras directory)
5. Create a simple inetrface to run the application.

Future Enhancements
1. Improve model accuracy with a larger dataset
2. Support for additional sign languages
3. Implement text-to-speech conversion
